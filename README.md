## Blog

Forked!

Forked for specific usage on https://www.octolot.com

Mainly stripped of CSS and tweaked.

## Original README

This Meteor package gives you a basic, out-of-the-box blog at `/blog`. We wanted a
way to add a blog to an existing app without running another dyno or server for
a meteor-based blog.

Example instance: http://differential.com/blog
